# Krinal's Portfolio

Hello, I am krinal.
I have 1+ year experience in developing and analyzing machine learning model related to NLP and Audio with my skills in text preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization.

I am also a book reader and music lover ;-)

### Skills
- **Programming:** Python
- **Database:** Postgres
- **Machine Learning:** Huggingface transformer, PyTorch, NLTK, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Wandb
- **NLP:** Sentiment Analysis, Text classification, Named Entity Recognition, Spell correction, Parsing
- **Audio:** Text To Speech, Speech To Text, Voice Activity Detection, Automatic Speech recognition
- **Other:** Git

### Experience
**Software Developer @ Floatbot (Mar 22 - Dec 23)**
- Developed a custom spell correction system using py-spellchecker with 60% less false positives
- Designed and trained a machine learning model for intent classification with scikit-learn and PyTorch resulted in improving overall system performance by 20%
- Integrated a semantic search to find text similarity using a SentenceTransformer with 70% accuracy
- Enhanced query-based document search with term frequency-inverse document frequency that streamlines overall search time
- Improve automatic speech recognition system 30% by fine-tuning a wav2vec2 model with real-time speech inference
- Implemented a Nemo text-to-speech vocoder model for Hindi language integration, enhancing chatbot conversational experiences with a 40% increase in accuracy and customer engagement
- Trained a sentiment analyser with NLTK tokenizer and NaiveBayesClassifier with 78% accuracy
- Evaluated performance of llama, GPT-3, BERT, FLAIR, Vocoder models, and tools like Nemo Guardrails and Argilla to optimize existing platform; increased model accuracy by 15% and reduced platform latency by 20%



### Open Source Contributions
- Contributed to Microsoft presidio: write a module to recognise Indian voter id with a predefined regex pattern with a base score, test cases, and docs to detect personal identification information [[PR]](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio/pull/1345)
- Deployed a fine-tuned named entity recognition model on Huggingface using span marker and Roberta-base on a few-nerd dataset with 93% accuracy and 77% f1 score

### Education
- <p>ME Information Technology @ Shantilal Shah Engineering College, Bhavnagar (2021)<p>
